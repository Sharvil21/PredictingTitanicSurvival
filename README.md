# PredictingTitanicSurvival
This project focuses on determining which attributes led to the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

It is about the RMS Titanic's early morning sinking on April 15, 1912. This tragedy killed over 1,500 people.
We want to know what attributes helped passengers survive the sinking, given the socioeconomic and gender inequality in the past. 
Our research question is whether ticket class, gender, or port of embarkation are statistically significant predictors of surviving the Titanic. 
In addition, we want to know how these attributes affect the probability of survival on the Titanic. These attributes were chosen because they give us additional information about the passengers.
Ticket class symbolizes their socioeconomic level, and examining gender analyzes whether it is a vital role in a passenger’s survival. 
Finally, the port of embarkation represents the passenger’s origin.

This was carried out as a part of the final paper presentation for a Graduate Level Course
